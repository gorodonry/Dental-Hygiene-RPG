# Dental-Hygiene-RPG

**Description**
The kingdom is in turmoil – dental aberrations are running amok! Nobody quite knows why, and nobody knows who is responsible, but nobody is safe while they’re around. Fight your way through various enemies until you meet the one orchestrating it all…

**Further Information**
Gameplay is intuitive and entertaining, choices are usually multichoice with set responses. You start off as a low level character with a few weapons - acquire more and level up throughout the game. Fight monsters along the way - different attacks are effective against different monsters - see if you can work out which ones and why!

**Side Note**
This was created primarily as a response to a L2 NCEA assessment.
